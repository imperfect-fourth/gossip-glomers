0	:info	:broadcast	0	indeterminate: Malformed RPC response. Maelstrom sent node n0 the following request:

{:type "broadcast", :message 0, :msg_id 1}

And expected a response of the form:

{:type (eq "broadcast_ok"), {:k :msg_id} Int, :in_reply_to Int}

... but instead received

{:in_reply_to 1, :message 0, :msg_id 1, :type "broadcast_ok"}

This is malformed because:

{:message disallowed-key}
